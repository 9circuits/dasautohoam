About DasAutoHoam

DasAutoHoam is a collection of code/algorithms/way-of-life to automate a general home. Automate lights, fans, air conditioners your tv etc.
This project is based on the standard Arduino system utilising the AVR chip conceived by ATMEL and ofcourse the legendary python toolkit
Once, the control using Arduino is established controlling the whole thing using an x86/x64 processor directly via USB or Serial will be developed

DasAutoHoam is licensed under GNU GPLv3 license so you cannot use it commerically. You can however take the code beat the crap out of it and develop something
new on it. All the tools used in this development are open source and lot of fun.
